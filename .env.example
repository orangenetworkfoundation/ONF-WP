# ONF WP 1.0.3 Environment Configuration Example
# COPY this file to .env and then customize your .env file.

# -- Critical Project Identifier --
# IMPORTANT: This MUST be unique for each ONF-WP project you run on your system.
# It's used for naming Docker containers, volumes, networks, and database resources.
# Use lowercase alphanumeric characters and underscores/hyphens if needed (e.g., my_awesome_site, clientprojectx)
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=onf_project

# -- Project Domain --
# IMPORTANT: Change this in your .env file to a unique domain for your project.
# Use a .localhost or .test domain for local-only testing (e.g., my-site.localhost, my-project.test)
# Use your real domain if using Cloudflare Tunnel (e.g., my-site.com)
PROJECT_DOMAIN=onf-wp.localhost

# -- Web Server Ports (Traefik) --
# Change these in your .env file only if these ports are already used on your computer.
TRAEFIK_HTTP_PORT=8000  # Port for HTTP access to your site via Traefik
TRAEFIK_HTTPS_PORT=8443 # Port for HTTPS access to your site via Traefik (if HTTPS is enabled in docker-compose)
TRAEFIK_WEBUI_PORT=8081 # Port for the Traefik dashboard (access via http://localhost:8081)

# -- Optional Database Port Forwarding --
# Uncomment and set a host port if you want to connect to MariaDB directly from your host machine (e.g., with a GUI tool)
# MARIADB_PORT_FORWARD=33061

# --- WordPress Admin Credentials ---
# For the 5-minute WordPress installation, you will set up your admin user,
# password, and email directly in your web browser after `docker-compose up -d`.
# These are NOT set here in the .env file for this setup.

# --- Database Credentials (Informational) --- 
# These are typically NOT changed here. They are derived from COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME
# or set within docker-compose.yml for simplicity and uniqueness per project.
# Default Database Name in container = value of COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME
# Default Database User in container = value of COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME
# Default Database Password in container = localdevpassword_for_<value of COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME>
# Default Database Host from PHP container = mariadb
